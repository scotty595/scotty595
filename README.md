# Hi there, I'm Scott 👋

## 🚀 What I'm Building

**[DriftOS](https://github.com/DriftOS)** – Conversation graph engine for AI

Turning flat chats into explainable, navigable graphs. When AI conversations drift, we branch.

- 🌳 Automatic branching on semantic + functional drift
- 🧠 Time-decay clustering for natural memory
- 🎯 Deterministic orchestration with full observability
- 📊 Production-ready TypeScript infrastructure

**Status:** Seed stage | Patent filed (70+ USPTO claims) | London-based
